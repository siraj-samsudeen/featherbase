# Progress Log

Newest entries first. Every session appends: date, feature ID worked on,
what was done, how it was verified, what to pick up next, gotchas.

## 2026-07-15 — Initializer session complete: stack boots green

- Scaffolded pnpm monorepo: `apps/server` (Hono, `postgres` client, error
  envelope, SQL migration runner, `/api/ping`), `apps/web` (Vite + React 19 +
  Tailwind v4 + TanStack Router/Query, login + desk shells, Playwright),
  `packages/shared` (placeholder for META-013 zod generator).
- **Database decision (user-approved): local system Postgres 16 cluster on
  port 5432, NOT Supabase.** `init.sh` starts it via `pg_ctlcluster`, sets
  postgres password to 'postgres', creates `frappe_clone` db.
  `DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/frappe_clone`.
  Supabase-flavored features map to local equivalents (see CLAUDE.md).
- Verified end-to-end: `./init.sh` exits 0 — migrations apply, server :8000
  and web :5173 boot, server smoke (ping+db) and Playwright smoke (login
  page renders, API via proxy) all pass.
- **Gotchas**: (1) Docker daemon is not running in this environment — do not
  try Supabase local or docker compose. (2) Playwright must use
  `executablePath: '/opt/pw-browsers/chromium'` (already in
  playwright.config.ts). (3) Piping `./init.sh | tail` never returns EOF
  because the spawned dev servers hold the pipe; run it as
  `bash init.sh > /tmp/init.log 2>&1` and read the log instead.
  (4) `pkill -f init.sh` will kill your own shell if the command string
  contains "init.sh" — use exact patterns.
- **Next session**: META-001 (doctype/docfield storage + Meta loader).

## 2026-07-15 — Harness initialized (no code yet)

- Repo contains strategy (`docs/ROADMAP.md`) and the agent harness
  (`CLAUDE.md`, `harness/`). No application code exists yet.
- **Next session**: run the initializer prompt (`harness/prompts/initializer.md`)
  to scaffold the monorepo, Supabase local config, and `init.sh`, then start
  on `META-001`.
- Gotchas: none yet.
