## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A new access rule needs a new, reviewed version

An app SHALL only gain a new access rule — such as who may read or act on
one of its tables — by shipping a new, reviewed version; Featherbase SHALL
NOT let an already-installed version quietly pick up a rule it didn't
originally declare. A new version MAY withdraw a rule its predecessor
declared; applying it SHALL remove only the grant that app created, and
record the withdrawal in the activity log. The image SHALL ship the installed
predecessor beside the new version so the upgrade can find it.

#### Scenario: An old version can't gain a new rule for free

- **WHEN** an app adds an access rule that its currently installed version
  never declared
- **THEN** using it requires installing that reviewed new version, previewed
  and turned on like any other upgrade

#### Scenario: A new version can withdraw a rule

- **WHEN** an upgrade's new version no longer declares an access rule its
  installed version declared
- **THEN** the preview lists the rule as withdrawn
- **AND** applying the upgrade removes the grant the app created, and no other
- **AND** the activity log records the withdrawal
